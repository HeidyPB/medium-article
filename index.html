      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
       "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.

      <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
      <p>
        In short, remember that you should never use HTML to modify the appearance of content because that is the role of CSS. If you falsify everything by declaring, for example, titles that are not titles, you pervert the role of HTML and this will have a strong impact on the quality of your web page, its validity and your overall referencing.
